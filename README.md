# Operating Systems Laboratory (CS39002)


Designed and implemented a custom user-level thread library in C (foothread) for Linux, focusing on process-level synchronization using semaphores.

Developed key thread management features including thread creation, termination, mutexes, and barriers, ensuring efficient synchronization without busy waits.

Engineered a dynamic library, libfoothread.so, and verified its functionality through a multithreaded application to compute sums in a tree structure.

Utilized system calls like clone() and gettid() for thread handling, reinforcing concepts of thread-specific IDs and synchronization primitives.
